# Introduction
This project uses data gathered from the [U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Annual Business Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html), which provides information on both economic and demographic characteristics for businesses and business owners. Survey responses are gathered into four census datasets: Company Summary, Characteristics of Businesses, Characteristics of Business Owners, and Technology Characteristics of Business. We used data only from the Characteristics of Businesses and Characteristics of Business Owners datasets.
